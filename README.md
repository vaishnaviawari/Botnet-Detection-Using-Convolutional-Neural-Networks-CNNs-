# Botnet-Detection-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting botnet traffic in network data. The model is trained and evaluated on network traffic data to identify patterns indicative of botnet activity.
Can refer to make final year projects.
